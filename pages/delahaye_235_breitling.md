## Overview

After stopping its activity during world war II, Delahaye resumed its production in a battered but recovering French economy. With punitive tax measures aimed at luxurious non essential goods and increasing competition, Delahaye saw its premium sports cars construction drop to unsustainable levels. The Type 135M was in essence the same as the pre-war model - with the classic 3.6 liter tri carburetor setup boosted up to 160 horsepower in its liveliest version. The partnership with the great Coachbuilders also resumed, lead by Chapron, Figoni, Saoucthik, Letourneur & marchand and other Iconic artworkers.

In 1946, the Type 175 was introduced in Paris Auto salon. A new monocoque chassis powered by a significantly larger inline overhead cam 4.5 liters engine garnered significant attention, but failed to inverse the Delahaye trend - with some citing conception issues and unfavorable context. An estimated total of 52 were produced until 1951 - when Delahaye introduced the Type 235 in Paris Auto Salon.

The Type 235 is seen by many as Delahaye last attempt to revamp to renowned Type 135 for the 50's.  With the modern ponton-style bodywork created by the designer Philippe Charbonneaux, an improved version of the 3.6 liter six inline engine from the 135MS was retained. The chassis was also similar to its predecessor, along with new hydraulic brakes and suspension.

The last of the 85 Type 235 built appeared at the Paris salon in 1954 and another Grande Marque met its end, leaving us its heritage for when the automobile was also a piece of art.
