## Overview

In 1926, Augustus Bertelli, Bill Renwick and a group of investors took over the then financially troubled car maker and renamed it Aston Martin Motors. From 1926 to 1937, Bertelli lead the brand as technical director, designer and pilot, producing and racing outstanding sports cars. Using the previous technological marvel developped with Renwick, Aston Martin introduced an overhead cam four cylinder derived from the "BuzzBox" to develop the 1.5 liter First Series, among which the "T-Type", "Standards Sports Model" and the "International".

In 1928, with Bertelli's competition experience, Aston Martin Motors entered Le Mans race with two 1.5 liter prototypes, the LM1 and LM2. Having lightened components and developed the dry sump version of the engine - now developing 63 horsepower - Aston Martin became then a competitive contender.

The "International" model was first introduced at 1929 London motor show. Inspired from the "Standard Sports Model", it retained the dry sump technology from the 1928 Le Mans team cars, a technological marvel for its time which made her one of the most desirable sports car. Available in many configurations, it was mostly produced in the short chassis 2/4 seat arrangement as the "International Four seater sport" which provided the best performance overall as a simple and elegant performer.

A total of 129 International first series have been built up to 1932, most of them bodied by Enrico Bertelli Ltd, until Aston Martin Motors stopped the production in favor of the iconic "Le Mans" model.
