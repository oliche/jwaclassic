The restoration began in 2011 by the Ateliers Yann Carrat Automobiles, on a very sound base that had not been previously restored, thus enabling to restore very close to the original.
In October 2011, the Rochet-Schneider 26-Six N° 29359 entered the Concours d’Elégance de Deauville and won the following prizes :
* The «Volant d’Or»
* The Best of Show
* The jury’s’ Grand Prix for the best restoration

## Beyond all superlatives

This is how Pierre-Lucien Pouzet recalls the R-S 26-Six in his book : « Rochet-Schneider un Grand Constructeur d’Automobiles à Lyon », and this is not surprising:
* Double ignition ( by magneto and coil ) which can be used separately or simultaneously
* Brakes with internal frictions and assistance
* Lubricating oil purifier with double oil pumps
* The oil cooler can be disengaged during cold  weather
* Double barrel carburettor with automatic connection at high speeds
* Centralised greasing by foot pedal
* An aviation type instrument panel

At the 1929 Paris Motor Show, the 26-Six was the most expensive (together with the Hispano–Suiza). In "la Vie de l’Automobile",  the columist concluded his presentation as follows: "As can be seen, the manufacturers of Lyon wanted their cars to be perfect in all respects, and we have to admit that they have attained their goal"

But the industrial crisis put an end to the high hopes of the marquee and to the "26-Six" which was the last passenger car made by Rochet-Schneider.
