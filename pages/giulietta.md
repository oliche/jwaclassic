## Overview

First presented in 1957 "Salone dell'Automobile di Torino", the Alfa Romeo Giulietta Sprint Speciale streamlined bodywork is an iconic classic Alfa Romeo. The Giulietta SS was inspired from the BAT " Berlinetta Aerodinamica Tecnica" experimentation - an aerodynamic project from Alfa Romeo and Bertone design studio, lead by the chief designer Franco Scaglione. After the dramatic styling exercise BAT5, BAT 7 and BAT 9 - the less extravagant but nonetheless sensational "Sprint Spinta" prototype was born and presented as the "Sprint Speciale" in 1957 in Turin.

Official production began in 1959 with 101 750 SS "Low Noses" with aluminum doors, steel body and plexiglass windows. Initially designed as a racetrack contender for the Giulietta Sprint Veloce Zagato (SVZ), the Giulietta Sprint Speciale was too heavy to seriously compete, pushing Alfa Romeo to review her positioning to a gracious junior grand touring car.

The second iteration Tipo 101.20 was the evolution for a lighter - higher performance top of the line coupe, a unique and stylish alternative to Porsche 356 or Austin Healey: steel doors instead of aluminum, Weber 40DCOE2 carburetors and a 70mm higher nose to comply with US regulations. The interior also became more comfortable - with added padding and better insulation. This second version is the final Giulietta Sprint Speciale in production until 1966, with a total of 1366 Giulietta SS created.

In 1963, the "Giulia SS" was presented in Geneva Motor show. She retained the slick aerodynamical body styled by Bertone of its little sister and was fitted with a larger 1.6L engine developing 112 horsepower and additional comfort. Production also run until 1966 with 1400 Giulia SS manufactured.

## Features

"Handbuiltâ€¦ and decidedly expensive" - titled the Alfa Romeo 1960's sales brochure. Marketed as a stylish coupe, the Bertone design featured an astonishing drag coefficient of 0.28 - which was not surpassed for 20 years. The Giulietta SS Tipo 101.20 bodywork is mostly steel, retaining only the bonnet and boot lid as aluminum, which brings her weight to a respectable 950kg, compared with the 750kg shown by her initial rival the Giulietta Sprint Zagato.
The Giulietta SS is powered by the 1290cc Alfa Romeo Twin Cam engine "Bialbero" known as the "Nord" due to its fabrication in Milan. Similar to the berline Giulietta motorization, it has been pushed to 100 horsepower at 6500 rpm thanks to its two side draught Weber 40DCOE2 twin choke carburetors and a compression ratio brought to 9.7:1. She claims a maximum speed of 193 km/h (120 mph).

## History
This 1962 Giulietta Sprint Speciale is a "matching number" with the initial engine. She also came with a replacement engine issued from the Giulietta Ti with a slightly lower compression ratio - which makes her perfect for enjoying casual touring and/or  classic races participation.
The restoration has been minimal and she retains most of her original interior - including the rare 4 fitted leather luggage and their strap behind the seats - a dedicated feature seldom found nowadays and originally presented in the 1957 Bertone accessory and special finitions catalog .
