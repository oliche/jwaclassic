The DELAHAYE brand  figures among the most sought after coachwork during the interwar period.

The car model « 135 » released in the thirties inspired masters coachwork makers of the time.
From the restrained to the most dazzling and exuberant makers, all created on this chassis.

Tradition and luxury meant that the lucky buyer of a DELAHAYE could choose the coach maker according to his preference, 
while the car maker would merely provide the chassis and the engine (_châssis-moteur_).
